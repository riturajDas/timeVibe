An OCD-ed time keeping application for those who hate wasting time looking at the wall clock. Started out as a project to keep away my boredom after finding an awesome implementation of a digital clock for computer screens in "thecodeness" 's instagram posts which she probably uses to time her on-screen hours. And, I made one for my damn self now and you can use it too!
